# Svelte Type Checker

Provides deep type checking for Svelte files by leaning on the Typescript language service.

Requires a Svelte language mode plugin such as [Svelte Beta](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode)

For best results, disable the typescript complete, hover, and definition features of the Svelte plugin and enable all the settings of this plugin.

### Features provided 

* Type checks regular JS as well as Typescript
* Type checking of component template (including prop types and slots)
* Autocomplete for component props
* Go to definition for components and props
* Hover information for template attributes
